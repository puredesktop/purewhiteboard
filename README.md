# purewhiteboard

**Sketch ideas and draw connected diagrams.** An app for [puredesktop](https://puredesktop.ai).

[Get started](#getting-started) · [App guide](docs/app-guide.md) · [Develop](docs/development.md) · [Developer account](https://puredesktop.ai/developers)

## What it does

A sketching and diagramming workspace built on Excalidraw. Combine shapes, text, arrows, and freehand drawing, save editable boards, and export PNG images for sharing.

## Requirements

Use a compatible [puredesktop](https://puredesktop.ai) build for desktop integration, storage, and the app drawer. Developer setup is covered in the [development guide](docs/development.md).

Create or open a board in the desktop. Agent assistance uses the host’s configured agent service.

## Getting started

1. Create or open a board and add shapes, text, arrows, and freehand marks.
2. Move and style elements to organize the diagram.
3. Save the editable board as a `.whiteboard` package; export PNG when you need a shareable image.

## App layout

| Area | What you use it for |
| --- | --- |
| **Drawing canvas** | Pan and zoom around the board and arrange its elements. |
| **Drawing tools** | Choose selection, shapes, arrows, text, or freehand drawing. |
| **Selection controls** | Adjust the appearance of selected elements. |
| **Board actions** | Open and save editable boards and export an image. |

The app also uses the shared [puredesktop](https://puredesktop.ai) shell and drawer agent. Panels can vary with the current view and selection.

## Working with the agent

Open the app’s drawer in [puredesktop](https://puredesktop.ai) and describe what you want to do. For example:

> Add three labeled steps and connect them with arrows.
>
> Export this board as a PNG.

The app exposes 11 tools, including `openWhiteboard`, `getWhiteboardContext`. See [agents.md](agents.md) for workflows and [plugin.json](plugin.json) for the complete tool schemas and approval flags. Adding shapes and text can apply directly; removal, clearing, and export are approval-marked tools.

## Files and data

Save editable `.whiteboard` packages and export PNG images. A PNG is a presentation output; keep the package to continue editing elements.

## Develop and customize

We welcome **developers and vibecoders alike**. Fork purewhiteboard, add a feature, or use what you learn to build a new app.

| Develop your way | Workflow |
| --- | --- |
| **Claude Code, Codex, or your editor** | Open the app’s source folder, read `README.md`, `plugin.json`, `package.json`, and `agents.md`, then make changes and run the app’s checks. Test inside [puredesktop](https://puredesktop.ai) with matching shared platform packages. |
| **purefactory** | Choose **Start building** for a new app, or select an available app project to extend it. Use **Open folder** for external tools and **Open app** to test. |
| **App drawer** | Request a local app change where app-development integration is available. Make clear whether you want to change the app itself or its current document. |

Use **Share** in purefactory to create a `.pureapp` package, then **Settings → System → Install an app → Choose package…** to load it in current builds. Source availability and integration vary by host build.

Follow the [development guide](docs/development.md) for Claude Code/Codex commands, app-specific setup and checks, and packaging. A standalone browser preview does not provide every desktop service.

## Documentation and limitations

| Guide | What it covers |
| --- | --- |
| [App guide](docs/app-guide.md) | App overview, source layout, and usage. |
| [Development guide](docs/development.md) | External coding tools, purefactory, checks, and installation. |
| [Agent guide](agents.md) | App-specific agent workflows and constraints. |
| [Agent contribution skill](.agents/skills/contribute-purewhiteboard/SKILL.md) | Clone or fork, implement and check changes, open PRs, create issues, and comment. |

Agent styling covers supported element properties; arrange and resize elements on the canvas. Export requires a non-empty board.

## Contributing and marketplace

We welcome **developers and vibecoders alike**. Go to [puredesktop.ai](https://puredesktop.ai) and [create a developer account](https://puredesktop.ai/developers) to join the developer community and submit your app for review.

Bring improvements to this app, develop a fork, or build something entirely new. We welcome **open-source and proprietary projects alike** to the [puredesktop](https://puredesktop.ai) marketplace. Support for **paid apps is coming soon**, so you will be able to charge for your apps if you choose. Forks and redistributed dependencies must follow their applicable licenses.

For developer access, app submissions, or marketplace questions, contact [info@puredesktop.ai](mailto:info@puredesktop.ai).

Anyone may use, study, modify, and share this app under its applicable licenses. We welcome pull requests, bug reports, and documentation improvements. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Contribute with a coding agent

Give your agent the [contribution skill](.agents/skills/contribute-purewhiteboard/SKILL.md) and describe the change, issue, or comment you want it to make. Codex can discover it in `.agents/skills/contribute-purewhiteboard/`; with Claude Code or another tool, ask it to read that `SKILL.md` explicitly. For example:

> Read `.agents/skills/contribute-purewhiteboard/SKILL.md`, implement [describe the change], run the relevant checks, and open a pull request to `puredesktop/purewhiteboard` from my fork.

The skill includes app-specific checks and workflows for PRs, issues, and comments. Anyone with a GitHub account can contribute; merging is reserved for `esetera` and `MRdevTagg`.

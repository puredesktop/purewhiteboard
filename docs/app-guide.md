# purewhiteboard app guide

A sketching and diagramming workspace built on Excalidraw. Combine shapes, text, arrows, and freehand drawing, save editable boards, and export PNG images for sharing.

## Workspace layout

| Area | What you use it for |
| --- | --- |
| **Drawing canvas** | Pan and zoom around the board and arrange its elements. |
| **Drawing tools** | Choose selection, shapes, arrows, text, or freehand drawing. |
| **Selection controls** | Adjust the appearance of selected elements. |
| **Board actions** | Open and save editable boards and export an image. |

## Working with purewhiteboard

1. Create or open a board and add shapes, text, arrows, and freehand marks.
2. Move and style elements to organize the diagram.
3. Save the editable board as a `.whiteboard` package; export PNG when you need a shareable image.

## Development and loading

We welcome **developers and vibecoders alike**. [Create a developer account on puredesktop.ai](https://puredesktop.ai/developers), then use Claude Code, Codex, your own editor, or purefactory to develop this app or create a new one.

The [development guide](development.md) covers preparing this repository's shared dependencies, starting a coding agent, adding features in purefactory, and checking the result in the desktop. It includes the commands available in this repository.

Use **Open folder** in purefactory to edit a project externally, and **Open app** to test it. Use **Share** to create a `.pureapp` package, then **Settings → System → Install an app → Choose package…** in current builds to install it. Older versions may provide **File → Install App…**. A development server URL alone does not install an app.

To extend this app in purefactory, select its editable project when available. Source development builds can expose the suite's own apps; packaged installations do not expose every built-in app's source. See [create or extend an app](development.md#create-or-extend-an-app-with-purefactory) for that distinction and the app drawer workflow.
